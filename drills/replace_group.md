## common git commands that you can't really explain
- 'commit'  If you don't know what this does, you're in trouble
- 'merge'   You probably think you understand this, but you'd be wrong.
- 'rebase'  When it works right, you're grateful.
- 'reset'   You definitely don't know what this is actually doing, but you're scared of it.
- 'switch'  Don't ever use this - use 'checkout' like a man.
- 'tag'     If someone asks you about this, you're out of luck.
